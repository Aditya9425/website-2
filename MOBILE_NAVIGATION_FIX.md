# Mobile Navigation Fix - Orders Section

## Problem Fixed
The hamburger menu in the Orders section (profile page) had the following issues on mobile:
1. ❌ Menu was opened by default on mobile
2. ❌ Menu didn't toggle properly when clicked
3. ❌ Menu overlapped with order details section

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Mobile Navigation Fix CSS (`mobile-navigation-fix.css`)
- **Closed by default**: Menu is hidden by default on mobile (`display: none !important`)
- **Proper toggle**: Menu shows only when `.active` class is added
- **No overlap**: Proper z-index and positioning to prevent overlap with content
- **Responsive design**: Works across all screen sizes

### 2. Updated Profile Page (`profile.html`)
- Added hamburger menu toggle button with proper ID
- Included the mobile navigation fix CSS
- Added proper navigation structure

### 3. Enhanced JavaScript Functionality (`profile.js`)
- Added `toggleMobileMenu()` function for proper menu toggle
- Added `initializeMobileMenu()` for initialization and event handling
- Added click-outside-to-close functionality
- Added nav-link-click-to-close functionality

### 4. Updated Main JavaScript (`main.js`)
- Made mobile menu functions consistent across all pages
- Used class-based approach instead of style-based approach
- Ensured proper initialization

### 5. Applied Fix to Other Pages
- Added mobile navigation fix to `index.html`
- Added mobile navigation fix to `collections.html`
- Ensures consistent behavior across the entire website
