# Stock Reduction Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete stock reduction system that automatically updates stock levels when orders are placed and reflects changes in real-time on the frontend.

## Key Features

### 1. **Atomic Stock Operations**
- Stock is deducted immediately when order is confirmed
- Rollback mechanism if order fails
- Database-level constraints prevent overselling

### 2. **Real-time Frontend Updates**
- Products automatically show "Out of Stock" when stock reaches 0
- Low stock warnings when stock ≤ 5
- Real-time updates across all pages

### 3. **Admin Panel Integration**
- Stock levels visible in admin panel
- Quick stock update functionality
- Stock alerts for low/out-of-stock items

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
Run the SQL script in Supabase:
```sql
-- Execute database-stock-setup.sql in your Supabase SQL editor
```

### Step 2: Files Added/Modified
- `stock-reduction.js` - Main stock management logic
- `out-of-stock-display.css` - Styling for stock indicators
- `main.js` - Enhanced order processing
- `index.html` & `collections.html` - Added script/CSS references

### Step 3: Testing the System

#### Test Scenario 1: Normal Order
1. Add product with stock > 1 to cart
2. Complete checkout process
3. Verify stock is reduced in database
4. Check frontend shows updated stock

#### Test Scenario 2: Last Item Purchase
1. Find product with stock = 1
2. Purchase the item
3. Verify product shows "Out of Stock"
4. Verify "Add to Cart" button is disabled

#### Test Scenario 3: Stock Validation
1. Try to add out-of-stock item to cart
2. Verify warning message appears
3. Verify item is not added to cart

## Key Functions

### Frontend Functions
```javascript
// Check stock before adding to cart
await checkStockBeforeAddToCart(productId, quantity)

// Refresh products after order
await refreshProductsAfterOrder(orderItems)

// Update product card stock status
updateProductCardStock(card, product)
```

### Database Functions
```sql
-- Deduct stock atomically
SELECT deduct_stock(product_id, quantity);

-- Restore stock if needed
SELECT restore_stock(product_id, quantity);

-- Check availability
SELECT * FROM check_stock_availability(product_id, quantity);
```

## Stock Flow Process

### Order Placement Flow:
1. **Validation** - Check if requested quantity is available
2. **Reservation** - Atomically deduct stock from database
3. **Order Creation** - Save order to database
4. **Status Update** - Update product status if out of stock
5. **Frontend Refresh** - Update all product displays
6. **Real-time Sync** - Notify other users of stock changes

### Error Handling:
- If stock validation fails → Show error, don't process order
- If order save fails → Restore stock automatically
- If payment fails → Restore stock automatically

## Admin Panel Features

### Stock Management:
- View current stock levels
- Quick stock update buttons
- Stock alerts for low inventory
- Bulk stock operations

### Stock Monitoring:
- Real-time stock updates
- Order impact tracking
- Stock history (future enhancement)

## Real-time Updates

### Supabase Realtime:
- Listens for product table changes
- Updates frontend immediately
- Syncs across all user sessions

### Frontend Sync:
- Updates product cards
- Shows/hides out-of-stock overlays
- Disables/enables action buttons

## Styling Features

### Visual Indicators:
- **Out of Stock**: Red overlay, disabled buttons
- **Low Stock**: Yellow warning badge
- **In Stock**: Normal appearance

### Responsive Design:
- Mobile-optimized stock indicators
- Touch-friendly admin controls
- Accessible color schemes

## Configuration

### Stock Thresholds:
```javascript
// Low stock threshold (can be modified)
const LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 5;

// Out of stock conditions
const isOutOfStock = stock === 0 || status === 'out-of-stock';
const isLowStock = stock > 0 && stock <= LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD;
```

### Notification Settings:
```javascript
// Stock notifications
showNotification('Product is out of stock', 'warning');
showNotification('Only 3 items left!', 'info');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Stock not updating**
   - Check database permissions
   - Verify Supabase connection
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Frontend not refreshing**
   - Ensure `stock-reduction.js` is loaded
   - Check real-time subscription status
   - Verify CSS classes are applied

3. **Admin panel not showing stock**
   - Refresh admin panel
   - Check database query permissions
   - Verify stock columns exist

### Debug Commands:
```sql
-- Check product stock
SELECT id, name, stock, status FROM products;

-- Check recent orders
SELECT id, items, total_amount, created_at FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Verify functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%stock%';
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
- Stock reservation system (hold stock during checkout)
- Inventory forecasting
- Automatic reorder points
- Stock movement history
- Bulk import/export
- Advanced reporting

### Integration Options:
- External inventory management systems
- Barcode scanning
- Supplier integration
- Multi-warehouse support

## Security Considerations

### Database Security:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Function-level permissions
- Audit logging for stock changes

### Frontend Security:
- Stock validation on server-side
- Prevent client-side manipulation
- Secure API endpoints

This implementation provides a robust, scalable stock management system that ensures accurate inventory tracking and provides excellent user experience with real-time updates.
