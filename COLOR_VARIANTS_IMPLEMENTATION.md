# Color Variants Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation treats each color variation as a separate product in Supabase, allowing for individual stock management, images, and unique URLs for each color.

## Database Structure

### New Columns Added to `products` Table:
- `color` (TEXT): Individual color name (e.g., "Red", "Blue", "Green")
- `color_code` (TEXT): Hex color code (e.g., "#FF0000", "#0000FF")
- `base_product_name` (TEXT): Groups related color variants together
- `slug` (TEXT): SEO-friendly URL slug for each product

### Example Data Structure:
```sql
-- Base Product: "Elegant Silk Saree"
-- This creates 3 separate products:

-- Product 1: Red variant
INSERT INTO products (name, base_product_name, color, color_code, price, stock, images, slug)
VALUES ('Elegant Silk Saree - Red', 'Elegant Silk Saree', 'Red', '#FF0000', 5000, 10, ['red_image1.jpg', 'red_image2.jpg'], 'elegant-silk-saree-red');

-- Product 2: Blue variant  
INSERT INTO products (name, base_product_name, color, color_code, price, stock, images, slug)
VALUES ('Elegant Silk Saree - Blue', 'Elegant Silk Saree', 'Blue', '#0000FF', 5000, 5, ['blue_image1.jpg', 'blue_image2.jpg'], 'elegant-silk-saree-blue');

-- Product 3: Green variant
INSERT INTO products (name, base_product_name, color, color_code, price, stock, images, slug)
VALUES ('Elegant Silk Saree - Green', 'Elegant Silk Saree', 'Green', '#008000', 5000, 0, ['green_image1.jpg'], 'elegant-silk-saree-green');
```
